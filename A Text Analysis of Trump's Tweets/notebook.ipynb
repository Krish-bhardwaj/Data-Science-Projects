Conclusion: The ghost in the political machine\n<p>There's a difference in style and sentiment between Trump's tweets from the Android and the iPhone. We know Trump used the Android until March 2017, but who was tweeting from the iPhone on Trump's behalf? I was fascinated by a <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/07/25/donald-trumps-ghostwriter-tells-all\">New Yorker article</a> about Tony Schwartz, Trump’s ghostwriter for <em>The Art of the Deal</em>. Of particular interest was how Schwartz imitated Trump’s voice and philosophy:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>In his journal, Schwartz describes the process of trying to make Trump’s voice palatable in the book. It was kind of “a trick,” he writes, to mimic Trump’s blunt, staccato, no-apologies delivery while making him seem almost boyishly appealing…. Looking back at the text now, Schwartz says, “I created a character far more winning than Trump is.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A lot has been written about Trump’s mental state. But I’d rather get inside the head of the anonymous staffer whose job is to imitate Trump’s unique cadence (“Very sad!”) or put a positive spin on it, to millions of his followers. Are they a true believer, or just a cog in a political machine, mixing whatever mainstream appeal they can into the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump\">@realDonaldTrump</a> concoction?
